# cv-open

## Computer Vision Code for OpenCV

As much as possible, the code in this repository should be OpenCV-specific without requiring the assistance of models and conveniences. As much as possible, the code should use just what OpenCV offers. When it comes time to start designing the alpha product, this repos will provide solid tools and techniques of the best practices of OpenCV.

## Goals

* Explore OpenCV to learn what it can do on its own
* Develop a body of commonly used actions that can be used in larger projects
* File actions
  * Open, read, and close a file
  * Show the contents of a file
* Inferences
  * Run inferences on video files or video camera file outputs
  * Do the various types of inferences, such as Classification, Object Identification, Tracking, etc.
* Avoid kludging together a bunch of  "stuff" and pray that we can fiddle with it well enough that it runs.
* Learn about the strengths and weaknesses of OpenCV.
