# cv-open
## Computer Vision Code for OpenCV

As much as possible, the code in this repository should be OpenCV specific without requiring the assistance of models and conveniences. As much as possible, the code should use just what OpenCV offers. The intention of this repos is to learn about the capabilities of just OpenCV so that when it comes time to start designing the alpha product, we have a reasonable knowledge base to build upon.

In this way, the intent of this repos is **not** to kludge together a bunch of  "stuff" and pray that we can fiddle with it well enough that it runs. Instead, this repos should teach us about the strengths and weaknesses of OpenCV.
